# Rajan Mali - Bankaks Image Compressor

I have created a full stack application that handles both the front-end using ReactJS, the back-end using NodeJS and Express and finally using Google Firebase for the cloud storage. in this application the user can upload an image with a resolution of `n*m` and it automatically gets converted into three image:

- One with `n x m px`
- One with `n/10 x m/10 px`
- One with `n/20 x m/20 px`

When the user uploads these images, a request is sent to the backend which uploads these three images to the Google firebase cloud storage. Once the images have been uploaded, the user is presented with preview links to view the uploaded images.
