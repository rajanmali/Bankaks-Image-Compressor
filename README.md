# Rajan Mali - Bankaks Image Compressor

I have created a full stack application that handles both the front-end using ReactJS, the back-end using NodeJS and Express and finally using Google Firebase for the cloud storage. in this application the user can upload an image with a resolution of `n*m` and it automatically gets converted into three image:

- One with `n x m px`
- One with `n/10 x m/10 px`
- One with `n/20 x m/20 px`

When the user uploads these images, a request is sent to the backend which uploads these three images to the Google firebase cloud storage.
