# Solution Statement

For both new and old users on the Bankaks platform, good user experience is a must and a part of that comes from having fast and responsive interfaces. When uploading a image taken on a smartphone which can be quite large nowadays, users might have to face long loading times to complete a trivial task. To overcome this hinderance, I have coded a Javascript demonstration which resizes the users uploaded photo down by 10 times and 20 times and uploads those images to an online cloud storage service

Unlike uploading the original iamge, uploading the images with reduced resolutions not only significantly reduces response time for the user and hence helps in creating a good UX and increasing user retention on the platform but also decreases storage and hosting costs for the company.
